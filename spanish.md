moving to a structured vault. First goal is to create a list of words encountered. The first step toward this goal is to decompose unstructured notes. To that end, I will move the unstructured notes to a to_be_processed dir then identify the most efficient way to structure the contained information. Secondly, I need to identify files which need to be indexed. these files will be moved to “to_be_indexed”. The end goal us a list of reference material which is at the same time testable through anki. Specifically, tables of verbs, nouns etc indexed by a number of parameters AND entered into anki for revision. While automated snyxhronization between anki and my markdown files would be preferred, I’ll end up spending too much time working on the code rather than studying spanish. So doing this manually will be the chosen route. use tags to note whether the word has been entered into anki.

Categories of notes include:

- word translations
- example sentences
- concept articles
- resource lists
- literature reading notes
