1. Learn the right words, the right way.
	- Don't need to learn all the words. Use the Pareto principle "the vital few", to learn the most important words, use flash cards.
2. learn cognates. Cognates are words that mean the same thing in two+ languages.
3. Interact in your language daily without traveling - use apps like tinein.com youtube videos, read blogs etc. Chrome plugin that translates parts of words.
4. Speak with a native.
5. Expand your vocabulary with mnemonics. memrise.com is useful for generating mnemonics.
6. embrace mistakes
7. create smart goals. S.M.A.R.T Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound.
	- use the common European Framework [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)
	- aim for B2 - intermediate.
8. learn to sound more native - learn the sounds, focus on intonations.
9. When traveling, fit in with the natives.

## To Develop a S.M.A.R.T Goal

I want to be a B1 by the time we travel to argentina - 3 mths. A B2 can:

- can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure etc,
- can deal with most situations likely to arise while traveling in an area where the language is spoken.
- can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes and ambitions briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.
