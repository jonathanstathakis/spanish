## Udemy 1-008

[Spanish 1-4: Beginner, Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/spanish-101-beginning-spanish-spanish-for-beginners/learn/lecture/52033#notes)

Presentar Personas - to introduce  
In this lesson we will recognise and answer the questions:  
Qué haces tú?  
Qué haces usted?

The demonstrative adjectives: introduce others using demonstrative adjectives or the expression 'te presento a..'

We will also recognise and answer the questions:  
Qué have él?  
Qué have ella?

And when talking about others, we will introduce using the verbs set and llamarse for asking and answering questions about others using basic information.

Qué haces = what do you do?

Presentar personas = To introduce people.

Este = singular masculine demonstrative adjective.  
Esta = singular feminine demonstrative adjective.  
Estos = plural masculine demonstrative adjective.

'They are' = Estos son/Estas son.

Te presento a Jaime y a Sean. I present to you Jaime and Sean.

Note the prefixing 'a' before each name.

Enfermera = nurse.

llamar to call.  
'Ella se llama vicky'  
She is called Vicky.  
Que hacé ella?  
Vicky es enfermera.

To be from a country, it is a property of the individual, a permanent one, hence set.

Vicky es perano.

Conocemos a vicky, que es peruana.

To be from Peru = peruano.  
To be from Venezuala, you say venezolano.

Note: don't capitalise countries.

Both countries and professions are permanent properties, hence es.

To practice = practicar.

Yo soy Jonathan/yo me llamo jonathan, Yo soy estudiante.

# Daily Summary

Today's idiom of the day was en concreto, which means to sum up. I processed the words 'varios', 'decidir', and 'desaparer', which mean 'various', 'to decide', and 'to disappear' respectively. Following this, I completed lesson 1-008, which covered introducing yourself and others.
