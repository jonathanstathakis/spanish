# Preterite Tense

Notes from [Lingvist](https://lingvist.com/course/learn-spanish-online/resources/spanish-preterite/).

Preterite tense is used for actions which have been completed.

## Regular Preterite Conjugation

---

| Subject | verbs ending in -ar | verbs ending in -er and -ir |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| yo | - é | í
| tú | -aste | -iste
| él, ella, usted | -ó | -ió
| nosotros | -amos | -imos
| vosotros | -asteis | -isteis
| ellos, ellas, ustedes | -aron | -ieron

For the above conjugations, a general rule is that for -ar suffixes, the conjugation starts with 'a'. for -er and -ir, it starts with I.

However, nosotros conjugation is the same as present tense. The author of the web page recommends using temporal words such as 'ayer' meaning yesturday, to emphasize the time that the action took place.

## When to Use Preterite Conjugation

- The preterite is used in same situations as the english simple past tense - the example the author of the website provides for english simple past tense is: jump + ed = jumped.
- The imperfect form should be used for ongoing actions.
- There is a difference between past actions that were habits that have now ceased, and actions that were completed singularly.

A continuous ****action, one which occurred in the past but is still ongoing, is denoted by the present continuous in english, and in spanis is denoted by the pattern: verb + estar + gerund. Gerunds in spanish have the suffix form *-iendo/-ando*
