¿Qué tiempo have? = What is the weather like?

states of the weather such as temperature are given as "¨The weather has **condition**"

"How is the weather today" = "¿Cómo está el tiempo hoy?"

i.e. "have frio en febrero"

frio is a quantity and thus to express lots of cold, use mucho: "have mucho frio" = it is very cold.

Conversely, the type of weather, such as cloudy, is a state, and thus uses muy: "esta muy nublado" = it is very cold.

However, rain is a quantifiable thing and thus uses mucho.

seasons in Spanish:

 | spanish      | english |
 | ------------ | ------- |
 | el inverno   | winter  |
 | la primavera | spring  |
 | el verano    | summer  |
 | el otoño     | autumn |

"how is the weather today?" = ¿Cómo está el tiempo hoy?

bad weather = mal tiempo

cloudy = nublado

dark = oscuros. A property of a subject.

llueve = raining, from llovar.

lots of rain = llueve mucho

nieva = snowing, from nevar.

mes = month

to say a month of a season you would say "mes de **season**"

viento = windy

To say "the weather is often bad here" it is acceptable to say: "A menudo have mal tiempo aqui" which is a fairly literal translation: often-have weather badhere

"this afternoon" = "esta tarde" literal translation.

cada = every, as in every thing in a selection. "cada clase" = every class.

**weather vowel** + time adverb implies "*it is* **weather vowel** + time adverb"

"I believe" = Creo que. From Crear.

There are = hay

~~I think you use the form "have tiempo" when talking about a time, such as a month. If youre talking about the waether itself then u refer to it as a person. el tiempo.~~
