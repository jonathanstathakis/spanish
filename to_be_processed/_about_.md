## An Assembly of Grammar Textbooks

Questions of spanish grammar are arising more and more frequently as I progress in my studies of the spanish language. While the internet is ok for these things, websites are too cluttered with ads, hard to navigate and generally insufficient. Thus I have downloaded Complete Spanish Grammar [[100-Active-Projects/200-Spanish/@nissenberg2020]] which is to be used as a resource on grammar.

Slowly going through all of my old notes, atomizing and filing them away. Its apparent how often I was going over the same content again and again, at the same level, for like a year..

This is a a rough sort, and each sub dir will probably need to be reassessed down the track.

I will need to study more nuanced grammatical terms such as impersonal verb, intransitive verb etc. They are all being lumped in 'verb' atm.
