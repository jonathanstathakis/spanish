There are several different methods of saying “I will”, as in, “I will x”, where x is an action, depending on the intent:

1. “voy a”. i.e. “I will study”: “voy a estudiar”. This is used to describe a future event
2. “haré”, i.e “haré mi tarea”: “I will do my homework”. Haré is used to indicste a promise or commitment.
3. “lo haré”, i.e. “no te preocupas, lo haré”: “don’t worry, I will do it.” This is used to emphasise that the action will be done.
